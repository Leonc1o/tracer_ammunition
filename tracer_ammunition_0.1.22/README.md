# Tracer Ammunition

Bullet overhaul mod for Factorio


# Bullet changes

Bullet travel through the game in real-time, they collide with objects and emit light.

- Manual aiming with mouse pointer
- Bullets have their own unique animation that has a chance to leave a tracer round, to make it easier to see
  where you are aiming during the day. 
- New ammunition added:
 - Bio Magazine, does poison damage over time
 - Incendiary Magazine, does fire damage over time
 - High Explosive Magazine, explodes!
 - Homing Bullets (new!) Follows your target and delivers a small explosive payload!
- Piercing Bullet and Piercing Shotgun Shell does real penetration now, if the enemy health is low enough.
- Each different magazine type emit their own unique light. Looks great with the "Clockwork" -mod by Yehn,
  or with "Light Overhaul" by Earandel (not fully tested, play at own risk!).
